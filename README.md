# Employee-Attrition
This project is a machine learning classification problem. The objective of this project was to predict the rate of employee attrition in the current scenario based on different features. It was the classification problem. I tried three algorithms (Logistics, Decision Tree &amp; Random Forest). But I got high accuracy score about 0.97 using random Forest.
